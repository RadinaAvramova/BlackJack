# Black Jack 
Welcome to the Black Jack project! This Python application allows users to play the classic card game of Blackjack against a computer dealer. With Black Jack, users can experience the excitement of trying to beat the dealer's hand and win virtual chips.

## Features
1. **Game Setup:** Sets up the game by creating a deck of cards and shuffling it before dealing cards to the player and dealer.

2. **Player Interaction:** Allows the player to make decisions during their turn, such as hitting (requesting another card) or standing (keeping their current hand).

3. **Dealer Logic:** Implements the logic for the dealer's actions, such as hitting until their hand value reaches a certain threshold (e.g., 17).

4. **Scoring:** Calculates the score for each hand and determines the winner based on standard Blackjack rules.

5. **Chips Management:** Tracks the player's chip count and adjusts it based on the outcome of each round (win, loss, or draw).

6. **Game Replay:** Allows the player to continue playing rounds of Blackjack until they choose to quit or run out of chips.

## Usage
To play Black Jack, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Program:** Execute the Python script to start the game:

2. **Place Your Bet:** Enter the amount of chips you want to bet for the current round.

3. **Play Your Hand:** Follow the prompts to decide whether to hit or stand based on your current hand and the dealer's upcard.

4. **Outcome:** After both you and the dealer have played your hands, the winner will be determined, and your chip count will be updated accordingly.

5. **Continue Playing:** You can choose to play additional rounds by placing another bet or quit the game at any time.

## Customization
1. **Game Rules:** Customize the game rules, such as the number of decks used, the threshold for the dealer's hitting, and the payout ratio for winning hands.
